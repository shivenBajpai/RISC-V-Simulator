Aug 1: Func signature syntax

Aug 2: Pipelined implementation

Implement IF,ID,EX,MEM,WB registers, have it execute from the registers on a stepwise basis.
We'll have a stall detector just using those conditions

Then we can add an implementation of forwarding

And we can add an implementation of branch prediction
possibly with multiple options for the predictor type.

But thats a lot of work.

Aug 3: Cache implementation

Aug 4: Memory usage indicator
