# Plan of actions

- After that we can implement functionality
- After that we can implement access trace 
- After that we prettify the cache table
- Gotta change tag display and trace and dump to not be 64 bit always

# New todo:

# Things that need testing (use valgrind while testing):

- Stats seem to be doing good
- Replacement policy is a completely untested.
- WB on replace testing

Then
- Deal with why the display tags are off
- Deal with cache.output file names
- Deal with cache line becomeing dirty after writing it to trace (new param)
